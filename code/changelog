sudoku (1.0.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added new commands:
    't' for renaming the title
    'o' for opening a board
    'w' for writing out a default template

  * Added early contradiction check to detect when for a given number all the
    squares are forbidden in a row, col, or block, to facilitate "solving" e.g.
    the following board:

        % 1221 unsolvable
         1 2 . | . . . | . . .
         . . . | 1 2 . | . . .
         . . . | . . . | 1 2 .
        -------+-------+-------
         2 1 . | . . . | . . .
         . . . | 2 1 . | . . .
         . . . | . . . | 2 1 .
        -------+-------+-------
         . . . | . . . | . . .
         . . 2 | . . 1 | . . .
         . . 1 | . . 2 | . . .

  * Fixed some array boundary handling flaws.
  * Fixed endless loop could occur when trying to load a fully populated board.
  * Fixed the completeness handling when a fully populated board loaded.
  * Improved the html output: More proportional display.
  * Embedded default template (with a 4:1 compression).
  * Moved the help text of the file related commands to the right side of the
    screen under a File category.
  * Improved editing capability with non-destructive white space, and horizontal
    scrolling the too long text-content in the input field.
  * Now can be compiled with VisualStudio 2012 Express on Windows Xp/Win7.
    - Added UNICODE support to curses.c (Needed when the no multibyte option used.)
    - Corrected the intensity handling on windows.
       - A_BOLD changed to (FOREGROUND_INTENSITY) used with attron/attroff.
  * Added makefile for MinGW.
  * Could not resist the temptation to reformat the source to my favorite style.
